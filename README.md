# Evergreen Scanner

We are creating a barcode scanning web app for the UPEI circulation staff, using the Evergreen server. This app is designed to make library workflows faster and easier by allowing staff to scan barcodes on books found throughout the library using a mobile device. The app connects directly to the Evergreen library system and marks the books as the status necessary instantly, so they can be quickly reshelved without needing to take them to the circulation desk. Staff can simply scan the barcode, and the app automatically updates the book's status in Evergreen in real time. The app also provides features such as confirming successful scans, handling errors like invalid barcodes, mark lost books, and logging recent activity for reference. This not only saves time and effort for staff but also ensures the books are available to other patrons as soon as possible. The app is simple to use, improves efficiency, and can benefit other libraries using Evergreen by streamlining their book-handling process.
